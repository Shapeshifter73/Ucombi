To use this website you first paste the url of the website (the http at the beginning or https is not necessary it will only return an error), next press the "submit button" to add another website iFrame to the page, this iFrame will then be stored in the local storage on your browser so that when you open your browser tab again the iFrames you see now will still be there. Overall UcombyÂ© can be used to host any un-protected site or online media in the world, I hope you enjoy!
